# DAHacks Privacy Policy

## Overview

Our privacy policy is aimed at making our online personal data practices more transparent out of respect to the privacy of our participants and people visiting and using our websites. Specifically, it describes what information we collect, how we collect it, and who has access to it. Most of this information is common sense, however we believe firmly in giving people the right to know how their information is being used.

Our policy applies to websites DAHacks owns and controls, including dahacks.com and its related subdomains. It does not apply to the personal data practices of our sponsors’ and partner organizations’ sites. Finally, the policy is subject to change at any time at the sole discretion of DAHacks without notice.

## Information We Collect

All of the personal information we collect on users can be categorized into one of four areas.

### 1. Personal Information of Applicants and Attendees

When you apply to attend DAHacks, you willingly provide us with information as part of your application and as part of forms you submit leading up to, during, and after our event. Unless specified below, this information is not shared with anybody outside of the DAHacks organizing team and is used only for application review and for purposes directly related to running our hackathon.

We also collect optional demographic information about our hackers. This information is anonymized and is used solely so we can gauge how we’re doing at our goal of making the hacking community more open and diverse.

### 2. Analytics Information

DAHacks uses Google Analytics to gather data about our sites’ users. This information is anonymized and used only to observe general patterns so that we can enhance our practices and user experience. For more information about Google Analytics, check out the [Google Analytics Terms of Use](http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html).

Third-party virtual platforms used for the event may collect their own analytics. We encourage participants to read the privacy policies of all platforms used.

### 3. Security Logging Information

DAHacks logs limited personal information such as user account information, the user’s IP address, and the web browser user agent whenever certain actions such as logging in and resetting a password are performed. This information is only used to locate and prevent unauthorized access and is never shared with anybody outside of the DAHacks organization.

### 4. Event video/audio recordings

DAHacks may record events, workshops, and webinars. These recordings may be shared with the general public to promote DAHacks.

## What We Share and Who We Share it With

The privacy and safety of our applicants and participants are always our highest concern. As a result, we want you to be aware of what information we share with our partners and sponsors.

### Our Sponsors

The primary motivators for why sponsoring companies attend and support DAHacks is to interact with our great participants. In return for their support, we provide certain sponsors with access to the following information about our hackers:

- Name
- Email
- GitHub Username
- School
- Major
- Any awards you may have won at the current DAHacks

You have the opportunity to decline providing any information to sponsors when you RSVP. Specifically, we never directly share your phone number or any demographic information.

### De Anza College

As part of our close partnership with De Anza College, we work directly with De Anza College staff to ensure our hackathon's success. To help them to do their job, we may provide De Anza College staff with personal information, such as dietary restrictions and emergency contact information, on request.

### Legal Purposes

Finally, we may share personal information with law enforcement and a court of law upon specific request to and beyond the extent required by law and by De Anza College's policies. Does this mean the NSA has a direct tap into our database? We would like to think not, but it's definitely not beyond the realm of possibility.
